# Features

There are endless features to add to an automatic plant grower, so it can better grow a plant. We'll first discuss the "Most Viable Product" (MVP) version, and then discuss future additional features.

Keep in mind if this was to be mass produced, the most viable product would be modified to support that level of product. Most notably, the lighting source. In our current implementation it made sense to go with a USB clip-on light source that already has a timer built in.

## Most Viable Product

### 1. Automatic lighting

### 2. Automatic watering via timer

## Future Features

### 1. Automatic watering via moisture sensor

### 2. Temperature and humidity control

### 3. Connection with smartphone
