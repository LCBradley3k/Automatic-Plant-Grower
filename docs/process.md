# Process / To Do List

1. Build a case with an open top

- [x] Buy the case [parts](parts.md).
- [x] Silicone together the four sides.
- [x] Cut that acrylic such that it fits the bottom.
- [x] Attach the bottom acrylic piece.
- [x] Do a leak test and add silicone if there are any leaks.

2. Purchase a light source
- [ ] Must easily attach to the case.
- [ ] Will it be powered by Arduino or by an outlet/USB port.
- [ ] Make sure voltage is correct.

3. Design automatic watering system
- [ ] Will water flow via gravity only or water pump?
- [ ] Decide how the water pump will be powered / wired up.
- [ ] What will the water be held in? How many gallons? Will this connect to the case or be a separate entity?
- [ ] Donâ€™t block the area in which the plant will grow.
- [ ] If using vinyl tubing, make sure it attaches well to the side of the case and does not look messy.
- [ ] Is the Arduino Uno sufficient in supporting the decisions made? If not, go back or consider buying a more sufficient Arduino micro-controller.
- [ ] Figure out the optimal amount of water to be released from the container.
- [ ] Program the Arduino to release the water at specific time intervals.

4. Decide on next [feature](features.md) to build
